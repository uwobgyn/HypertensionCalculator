# Instructions for using the model to predict chances of getting readmission with commandline
- To avoid compatibility issues, it is recommended to use Python 3.9.7, joblib 1.2.0, numpy 1.26.2, pandas 1.5.1, scikitlearn 1.1.3, scipy 1.11.4
- Uncomment line 31-36 and comment out line 39-40 in the "input.py"
- run "input.py" in terminal
- manually input the data seperated by space following the instructions, example: "138.0 85.0 122.0 71.0 22.7 41.1 29.0 141.0 89.0 0 0 0 0 0 0"
- the output value is the predicted probability of readmission
